# xFormers DevContainer

This directory contains the configuration files for a Visual Studio Code DevContainer. The purpose of this setup is to provide a pre-configured and reproducible development environment for working on the `xFormers` project.

-----

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get up and running with a pre-built `xFormers` development container using cached layers from Docker Hub.

1. **Fork the official repo**
   Go to [facebookresearch/xformers](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) and create a fork in your own GitHub account.

1. **Clone this devcontainer repo**

   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/AlexChesser/xformers-devcontainer.git
   cd xformers-devcontainer
   ```

1. Override the `xFormers` source repo

   * modify: `.devcontainer\devcontainer.local.json`

```json
{
  "name": "My GPU Devcontainer",
  "build": 
  {
    "args":
    {
      "XFORMERS_FORK_URL": "https://github.com/<my-github-username>/xformers.git"
    }
  }
}
```

1. **(Future enhancement)** Specify your GPU architecture

   * As of this moment this only supports **Blackwell RTX** (50xx series) cards, with broader coverage coming later. Please reach out if you would like support.
   * Planned: `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` will allow selecting a pre-built container optimized for your GPU (e.g. `8.6` for Ampere cards).

1. **Open in VS Code (or Cursor)**

   * Open this folder in VS Code.
   * When prompted, choose **"Reopen in Container"**.
   * Alternatively, open the command pallette and type **"Reopen in Container"**.

1. **Wait for expedited re-linking**
   The container will quickly link your fork of `xFormers` into an editable state.
   Trust me, you're still saving at least a half an hour or more on this.

1. **Start developing**
   Youâ€™re now inside a GPU-ready, pre-built `xFormers` dev environment.

### Automated Nightly Builds (future enhancement)

For a more robust solution, a **nightly build** is ideal for teams. This would involve a CI/CD platform (like GitHub Actions) that automatically builds and pushes a new image to Docker Hub every night. This ensures that the cached image is always up-to-date with the latest dependencies and security patches.

You could have a GitHub Actions workflow that:

  * Triggers on a schedule (e.g., every day at 1:00 AM).
  * Checks out the repository.
  * Runs the `docker buildx build --push` command to build and push the new image.

This fully automates the process and guarantees that your team always has a fast-starting devcontainer.


```
docker buildx build \
  --cache-from alexchesser/xformers-devcontainer:latest \
  --tag alexchesser/xformer \
  s-devcontainer:latest \
  -f .devcontainer/Dockerfile .
```

### enable use selectable list of images built per GPU (future enhancement)
for `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` this will skip the driver check in the VSCODE build process.
the vscode devcontainer build process does not support `GPUs --all` so in order to enable compilaiton for your RTX card, you need to update the dockerfile to support your architecture.

will work on a fix for this later - in the meantime I just want to get this working for my 5060.  Does anyone actually develop on an H100?!
